# Welcome to the ComPWA organization

The ["Common Partial Wave Analysis"](https://github.com/ComPWA) organization (ComPWA) aims to make amplitude analysis accessible through transparent and interactive documentation, modern software development tools, and collaboration-independent frameworks. For more information, see the [About page](https://compwa-org.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about.html).

The main projects that ComPWA is currently developing are:

- **[QRules](https://qrules.readthedocs.io)**<br>
  [![Documentation build status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/qrules/badge/?version=latest)](https://qrules.readthedocs.io)
  [![PyPI package](https://badge.fury.io/py/qrules.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/qrules)
  [![Conda package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qrules/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qrules)
  [![10.5281/zenodo.5526360](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5526360.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5526360)<br>
  a package that helps generating allowed transitions between quantum states on the basis of quantum number conservation rules.

- **[AmpForm](https://ampform.readthedocs.io)**<br>
  [![Documentation build status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ampform/badge/?version=latest)](https://ampform.readthedocs.io)
  [![PyPI package](https://badge.fury.io/py/ampform.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/ampform)
  [![Conda package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ampform/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ampform)
  [![10.5281/zenodo.5526648](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5526648.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5526648)<br>
  which helps to formulate amplitude models for different spin formalisms and with different dynamics.

- **[TensorWaves](https://tensorwaves.readthedocs.io)**<br>
  [![Documentation build status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tensorwaves/badge/?version=latest)](https://tensorwaves.readthedocs.io)
  [![PyPI package](https://badge.fury.io/py/tensorwaves.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/tensorwaves)
  [![Conda package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tensorwaves/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tensorwaves)
  [![10.5281/zenodo.5526650](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5526650.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5526650)<br>
  a fitter and data generation package for multiple computational back-ends.

- **[PWA Pages](https://pwa.readthedocs.io)**<br>
  [![Documentation build status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pwa/badge/?version=latest)](https://pwa.readthedocs.io)<br>
  an overview of the basis of Partial Wave Analysis that provides links to the most important literature and software in the field.

Finally, the [technical reports](https://compwa-org.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reports.html) on [compwa-org.rtfd.io](https://compwa-org.readthedocs.io) describe more general tips and tricks, some of which can be of interest to general Python users as well!
