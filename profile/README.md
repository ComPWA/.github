# Welcome to the ComPWA organization

The ["Common Partial Wave Analysis"](https://github.com/ComPWA) organization (ComPWA) aims to make amplitude analysis accessible through transparent and interactive documentation, modern software development tools, and collaboration-independent frameworks. For more information, see the [About page](https://compwa-org.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about.html).

The main projects that ComPWA is currently developing are:

- [QRules](qrules.readthedocs.io), a package that helps generating allowed transitions between quantum states on the basis of quantum number conservation rules.
- [AmpForm](ampform.readthedocs.io), which helps to formulate amplitude models for different spin formalisms and with different dynamics.
- [TensorWaves](tensorwaves.readthedocs.io), a fitter and data generation package for multiple computational back-ends.
- [PWA Pages](pwa.readthedocs.io), an overview of the basis of Partial Wave Analysis that provides links to the most important literature and software in the field.

Finally, the [technical reports](https://compwa-org.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reports.html) on [compwa-org.rtfd.io](https://compwa-org.readthedocs.io) describe more general tips and tricks, some of which can be of interest to general Python users as well!
